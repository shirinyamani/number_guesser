# Number Guesser Game

Welcome to the Number Guesser Game project! This is a beginner-friendly Python project where you will build a fun game that challenges the user to guess a randomly generated number. For each incorrect guess, the user will receive hints to help them, but at the cost of reducing their final score.

## 🎯 Objective
Your task is to create a game with the following features:

The game generates a random number between a given range (e.g., 1 to 100).
The user is prompted to guess the number.
For each incorrect guess, the user receives a hint. The hint should indicate whether the actual number is higher or lower than the guessed number.
Each incorrect guess reduces the user's score.
The game ends when the user guesses the correct number or decides to quit.

## 🏗️ Requirements
Organize your project with a clear directory and file structure.
Implement a scoring system.
Provide user-friendly messages and hints.
Ensure the user's input is validated.
